## D3 Visualizations

One of our goals for this project was to learn how to do some things in D3. In this folder you will find two interactive visualizations. 

imgSlider: visualizes historical data as a scrolling timeline of color coded maps
d3_readPlotColoredPointsOnMap: visualizes future climate projections as color coded snapshots that are clickable to reveal local time series

We would like to thank Proxima DasMohapatra for all her guidance and help on this front. (https://proximadas.github.io/)
