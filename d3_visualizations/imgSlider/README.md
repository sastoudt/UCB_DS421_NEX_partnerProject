## Image Slider for Historical Data

sliderDropdown.html contains the code needed to create a slider across yearly aggregated maps of historical data for a dropdown chosen variable/climate model pair.

See mockup.png for an example of what this would look like. The code needed to create all of the images can be found in the oneTagCode_histSlider folder.
