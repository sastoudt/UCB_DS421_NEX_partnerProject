# D3 Read Colored Points on a Map

When you run the code in the oneTagCode_rcpStaticImg folder the data needed for this visualization will be created. indexDropdown.html displays a heatmap of trend and variability for the future projections. Here we show a dropdown menu to pick within one climate model tag and all three climate variables. The dropdown could easily be adapted to include multiple climate model tags. For comparison purposes, one could pull up two different instances of this file and choose different options. Note this visualization will not work in Google Chrome.
